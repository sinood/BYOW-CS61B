# BYOW-CS61B
### Dark Halls: A castle-world with randomly generated rooms and hallways and interactive light sources.
Completed for project 3 in CS 61 B - Data Structures. I had to write most of the classes in the Core folder (except for  RandomUtils.java), which use various data structures and algorithms studied in the class to randomly create a world given a seed by the user. I implemented other features as well, such as saving/loading the world, a moving avatar, and light sources.
