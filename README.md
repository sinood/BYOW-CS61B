### Dark Halls: A castle-world with randomly generated rooms and hallways and interactive light sources.
Completed for project 3 in CS 61 B - Data Structures. I had to implement the MapGenerator class, which uses various data structures and algorithms studied in the class to randomly create a world given a seed by the user. I implemented other features as well, such as saving the world, a a moving avatar, and light sources.
